<h3>About Meâœ¨</h3>

ðŸ”¥ I'm a Python Backend Web Developer, as well as a specialist in creating scripts of any functionality and complexity and have been working in this area for 3 years.

ðŸ’¼ I'm a freelancer and I love my job.  My journey began in October 2021 year and I continue to move towards my goal. At the moment I have already a series of successfully launched commercial projects. I am not ashamed to admit that I am a novice developer, and even proud of it. After all, as one famous Turkish proverb says: "Not to know is not ashamed, ashamed not to ask"
